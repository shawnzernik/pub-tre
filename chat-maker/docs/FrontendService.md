# Prompt

The following is my backend Menu service:

```
<!! /Users/shawn/Projects/ts-react-express/backend/src/services/MenusService.ts !!/>
```

And the following frontend Menu service was created to access the backend Menu service.  Not that the class name is singular.

```
<!! /Users/shawn/Projects/ts-react-express/frontend/src/services/MenuService.ts !!/>
```

Please create me a frontend service for the following backend service:

```
<!! /Users/shawn/Projects/ts-react-express/backend/src/services/UserService.ts !!/>
```
