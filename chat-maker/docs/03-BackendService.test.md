# Prompt

The following is my user entity:

```
<!! FILE ~/backend/src/data/UserEntity.ts !!/>
```

The following is my user service:

```
<!! FILE ~/backend/src/services/UserService.ts !!/>
```

The following is my jest unit test for my user service:

```
<!! FILE ~/backend/src/tests/services/UserService.test.ts !!/>
```

Using the following entity:

```
<!! FILE ~/backend/src/data/%NAME%Entity.ts !!/>
```

And the following service:

```
<!! FILE ~/backend/src/services/%NAME%Service.ts !!/>
```

Create me a jest unit test like I did for the user service.
